 * more than a second, shows the engine's progress levels and offers Cancel.
 * A cancelled scan returns 0 with *cancelled set (cancelled may be NULL).

 * detection. From the event callback, gui_tree_event takes a press of S, ?,
 * Signatures, Directory or Log in panel and returns 1; after
 * xxwidgets_app_poll returns, gui_tree_process shows it modally over owner:
 * Signatures lists every loaded signature in the editor (S opens it on the
 * row's script) and Run executes the edited copy on the scanned file; ? shows
 * the bundled description, else a web search; Directory scans a folder with
 * the panel's flags; Log shows the engine's errors and warnings. Returns a
 * line for the status bar, or NULL. Rows of a tree not filled by
 * gui_tree_scan do nothing. */
